## Overview of Tackle

I introduce the Tackle project and talk about the main value of Tackle within a few lines.

## How Tackle fits into the overall Konveyor landscape

I refer to ![this diagram](assets/konveyor-projects.jpg)

> :construction: Questions for the SME

1. Tackle is seen at two places in the above diagram. Could you please write in a few lines on what Tackle component is the one sitting as the hub (left of screen) and which one(s) is/are at the refactor end alongside other sub-projects. 
2. Is Migration Toolkit for Containers part of the upstream project? I'm not going to write about it but just wanted to make sure that MTA is part of the upstream project (which this blog is referring to).

## How Tackle components come together to help you refactor applications to Kubernetes

I list the components that build the Tackle project and the focus of each of these components.

> :construction: Questions for the SME

1. Is the concept of **tools** and **components** same in Tackle? The list of **tools** under the Tackle project referenced [here](https://www.konveyor.io/tackle) and **components** referenced [here](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle) are a bit different. I assume that my focus will be the three main pillars: Application Inventory, Pathfinder and Controls. 
2. I see Tackle Container Advisor on the Konveyor website but not under the GitHub. Is this something that needs to be mentioned in the first of this Konveyor technical blog? I have seen [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapEooROERw) on Tackle Container Advisor.
3. Besides the overall Konveyor project diagram, is there a Tackle-specific architectural diagram that I can reuse?
